### Customization

If you want to edit the texture to something more reasonable, here are step-by-step instructions as to how you could do that.

1. Download [this barebones resourcepack](https://cdn.znopp.pw/EouFwt.zip)
2. Extract the zip file
3. Open it, then go into ``assets -> screaminggoats``
4. Once there, you will see the file for the texture. Edit it as you please, or replace it - But make sure it has the same name when you are done.
5. Apply the resourcepack (No need to re-zip it) and enjoy!

### No Forge?

Correct.
